  ITSOUTCHY EXE is a story about 3 powerful robots having to fight against the cruel humans who made and tortured them. Originally told in a 3D animation, this comic retells the story in a whole new way. This comic adds a new, never-before-seen layer of emotion and depth to the characters of ITSOUTCHY EXE.
